# 🌐 http-status-playground

A lightweight playground and test suite for experimenting with **HTTP status codes** — focused on writing test scripts and mocks rather than hosting servers.

---

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of **http-status-playground** is to help anyone **learn**, **test**, and **experiment** with HTTP responses by providing:

- Reusable **test scripts** to simulate various HTTP status codes
- Examples of **real API behavior** in Python Requests Library and Flask Server
- Guidance on validating how clients and integrations handle error and success responses  
- A curated list of **educational and practical resources** for understanding all HTTP status codes
